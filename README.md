# Bagging-Random-Forest

Try both the bagging and random forest models on the Telecom dataset. Remember, data exploration and feautre engineering still need to be done as you should always feed your model the most succint set of features. As always, continue best practice of scaling, K-fold cross validation etc.

Remember also to tune the relevant parameters of both Bagging and RF (number of trees, min_samples split etc.) 

For next week, please bring this completed notebook so we can review in class. 

** 23rd June ** 

Guys, please fit the RF and GradientBoostingregressor on the Boston Housing dataset and tune with the help of GridSearchCV.
